Binary code analysis involves the examination of compiled executables to infer program behavior, identify vulnerabilities, or detect malicious intent. 
Traditionally, methods such as symbolic execution and heuristic pattern matching were used  to understand binaries; 
however, these methods often suffer from scalability issues, lack of portability, and sensitivity to compiler transformations. 
Over the past few years, deep learning has been an attractive alternative because it offers
data-driven techniques that automatically learn representations directly from binary data, avoiding extensive manual feature engineering. 
While deep learning has improved detection rates and reduced false positives, these deep learning models have limitations.
For example, many models are treated as black boxes, making their decision processes difficult to interpret and sometimes leading to over-reliance on certain features that may not generalize well.
